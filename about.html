        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <p>
            I love playing video games it is one of my favorite hobbies. My friends and I are starting to play some games together. Sometimes it is difficult to play with each other, because I use a PC and they use a PS4. I'm really grateful now a days that most competive multiplayer games are cross-platform. So even if they have a PS4 I can still play with them with my PC. The games we have been playing recently are Call of Duty Cold War. We mostly play zombies, because it is a fun game mode to play. My friends want me to start playing Apex Predator. I've never played the game but my friends really like it. So I will try and play the game with them some time.
